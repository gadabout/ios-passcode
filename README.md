## Goal
Built a numeric passcode view that will grant access to an App. The passcode component needs to be implemented within a universal iOS app. Please see the example screenshot above.
## Requirements
Initial launch: Display the passcode view and ask the user to configure a passcode
#### Passcode Component:
- Should be reusable and self-contained
- The user inputs should use a custom UI to capture number tap by the user (not the native keyboard)
#### Application Flow
- On boot if no passcode has been saved, allow the user to configure a passcode:
    - The passcode should show up and ask the user to configure a passcode.
    - In order to save a passcode, the user must enter the same passcode twice in a row.
    - Persist the passcode where appropriate and display a message to confirm the successful action
- On boot, if a passcode has been configured
    - The passcode should show up and ask the user to enter his passcode.
    - After three incorrect entry, display an error message and lock passcode view for 1min until the user can try again.
    - On successful entry, display a message that grants access.
